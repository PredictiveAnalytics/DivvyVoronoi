DivvyVoronoi
============

A visualization of bike trips in Chicago. See what Divvy data can say about Chicago's geography.

Uses [data-workflow](https://github.com/deanmalmgren/data-workflow.git) to automate the entire data workflow, from munging to running the server locally. 

Requires numpy and data-workflow.

If you have data-workflow and numpy, all you need to do is git clone, type `workflow` in the command-line, wait ~90 seconds for the data crunching, and goto `localhost:8000` to see the locally hosted version of the visualization.
